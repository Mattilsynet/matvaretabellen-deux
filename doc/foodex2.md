# FoodEx2

FoodEx2 is a food classification system developed by the European Food Safety

[The food classification and description system FoodEx2 (revision 2)](https://doi.org/10.2903%2Fsp.efsa.2015.EN-804).
Chapter 5 describes how to interpret FoodEx2 Codes (such as `A01LH#F01.A064R$F02.A0ELC$F27.A01LH$F28.A07KQ`).
